#### Versioning

1. **Tracking changes**: Versioning allows me to keep track of changes I make to the website over time. This can be helpful if I want to revert to an earlier version of the website, or if I need to troubleshoot a problem that arises from a recent change.
2. **Collaboration**: Even though I'm the only one working on my website, versioning can make collaboration easier. If I ever decide to work with someone else on my website, versioning can help us keep track of changes and avoid merge conflicts.
3. **Backup**: By keeping multiple versions of my website, I can always go back to a previous version if I accidentally delete or overwrite something important.
4. **Documentation**: By attaching clear commit messages to each version of my website, versioning can serve as a form of documentation for my project, making it easier for me or others to understand what changes were made and why.
